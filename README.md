# Gloria Romanus

Backend of a Civilization-like game in Java. Features complex battle resolvers, factions, money, etc, using OOP principles and is based on MVC arhcitecture. Uni stuff.

Note to uni peeps: This is a special backend implementation since I did this project solo (normally you're paired up in teams of 3). Do NOT copy you will fail lmao.
